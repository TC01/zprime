This PDF was generated by a TeX file and a kludge of Python scripts to try and
do a bit more formatting to the raw output files and also to try and come up
with a painless way to post 3*27 plots and 3*27 event counts to ELOG that did
not involve sitting in front of a computer for hours and formatting the logs
and uploading the plots and clicking buttons.

Yell at Ben Rosser if you want more information about any of the cuts that were
actually used, or the actual plots or ROOT files or other data produced.

I'm sorry it's not better formatted, but I did my best with the kludge of Python
scripts.

(And, it's now trivial to upload results from the sequencer. :) For me, anyway ).
