zprime
------

All the various things I am hacking together for the zprime analysis.

This is the *new* zprime analysis now, the old stuff is still available in a branch.

## treemaker

This directory contains [Treemaker](https://github.com/TC01/Treemaker.git) config files,
along with a Makefile that can build everything. This is intended to be ran on CMSSW.

## cutmaker

This directory contains a modified version of the *old* zprime analysis code
(still available unchanged in a branch, 1d6449cebff59920db0f32b44d274f8535155031)
that is slightly more modular.

## theta

This directory contains modified [scripts from Marc](https://github.com/osherson/Zprime_to_Tt)
that use theta to do ttbar background estimation.

## TODO: write more code and stuff!

Requires theta installed.
