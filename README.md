zprime
======

All the various things I am hacking together for the zprime analysis.

Physics isn't quite like normal software development in the sense that the tools you write (unless you're very good) are
generally not used by other people. That's because you're not developing *software*, exactly. Your finished product is not
the tools to perform an analysis but the analysis itself.

The scripts and so on you write along the way are probably not terribly relevant later.

I don't think that's any excuse to do a bad job on them, though, because better tools = easier analysis. Hence this repo.
It'll probably stay private for now.

Stuff that I work on that *is* probably useful to other people will get spun off and publicized or whatever is necessary.
