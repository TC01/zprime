Plugins for [Treemaker](https://github.com/TC01/Treemaker) written for this Z'
analysis, along with Treemaker config files.

Due to Treemaker limitations / design features, these plugins need to be landed
in $CMSSW_BASE/src/Treemaker/Treemaker/python/plugins/. (The config files can go
anywhere).

The included Makefile can do that.

What each plugin does is documented inside. Same with the configs.
